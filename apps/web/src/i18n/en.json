        "category": "general",
        "question": "What is BienBon?",
        "answer": "BienBon is the first anti-food waste marketplace in Mauritius. It allows consumers to buy surprise baskets at reduced prices from local businesses, thus reducing food waste."
      },
      {
        "category": "general",
        "question": "Is BienBon available everywhere in Mauritius?",
        "answer": "BienBon is currently available in the main cities of Mauritius: Port-Louis, Curepipe, Quatre Bornes, Rose-Hill and Vacoas. We are progressively extending our coverage across the island."
      },
      {
        "category": "consumer",
        "question": "How does a surprise basket work?",
        "answer": "A surprise basket contains unsold products of the day selected by the merchant. You know the category (bakery, deli, etc.) and the approximate value, but not the exact contents — that's the surprise! The price is reduced by at least 50% compared to the actual value."
      },
      {
        "category": "consumer",
        "question": "How do I collect my basket?",
        "answer": "After your reservation, you receive a QR code in the application. Show it to the merchant within the time slot indicated during your purchase. The merchant scans your code and hands you your basket."
      },
      {
        "category": "consumer",
        "question": "Can I cancel my reservation?",
        "answer": "Cancellations are possible up to 2 hours before the collection slot. After this time, the payment cannot be refunded as the merchant has already prepared your basket."
      },
      {
        "category": "consumer",
        "question": "Is the app free?",
        "answer": "Yes, the BienBon application is completely free for consumers. You only pay for the price of the baskets you reserve."
      },
