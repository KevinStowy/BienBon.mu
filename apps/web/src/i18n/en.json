        "question": "What is BienBon?",
        "answer": "BienBon is the first anti-food waste marketplace in Mauritius. It allows consumers to buy surprise baskets at reduced prices from local businesses, thus reducing food waste."
      },
      {
        "category": "general",
        "question": "Is BienBon available everywhere in Mauritius?",
        "answer": "BienBon is currently available in the main cities of Mauritius: Port-Louis, Curepipe, Quatre Bornes, Rose-Hill and Vacoas. We are progressively extending our coverage across the island."
      },
      {
        "category": "consumer",
        "question": "How does a surprise basket work?",
        "answer": "A surprise basket contains unsold products of the day selected by the merchant. You know the category (bakery, deli, etc.) and the approximate value, but not the exact contents -- that's the surprise! The price is reduced by at least 50% compared to the actual value."
      },
      {
        "category": "consumer",
        "question": "How do I collect my basket?",
        "answer": "After your reservation, you receive a QR code in the application. Show it to the merchant within the time slot indicated during your purchase. The merchant scans your code and hands you your basket."
      },
      {
        "category": "consumer",
        "question": "Can I cancel my reservation?",
        "answer": "Cancellations are possible up to 2 hours before the collection slot. After this time, the payment cannot be refunded as the merchant has already prepared your basket."
      },
      {
        "category": "consumer",
        "question": "Is the app free?",
        "answer": "Yes, the BienBon application is completely free for consumers. You only pay for the price of the baskets you reserve."
      },
      {
        "category": "partner",
        "question": "How do I become a BienBon partner?",
        "answer": "Contact us at partners@bienbon.mu or fill in the partner registration form. Our team will contact you within 48 hours to finalize your registration and set up your account."
      },
      {
        "category": "partner",
        "question": "What types of businesses can participate?",
        "answer": "All food businesses can participate: bakeries, restaurants, delicatessens, grocery stores, supermarkets, cheese shops, etc. The only requirement is to have regular unsold items at the end of the day."
      },
      {
        "category": "partner",
        "question": "What commission does BienBon take?",
        "answer": "BienBon takes a 20% commission on each basket sold. You keep 80% of the sale price. There are no registration fees or monthly subscriptions."
      },
      {
        "category": "payment",
        "question": "What payment methods are accepted?",

        "answer": "Partners receive their payments every week, every Monday for the previous week's sales. The transfer is made to the bank account registered during registration."
      },
      {
        "category": "pickup",
        "question": "What happens if I can't collect my basket?",
        "answer": "If you can't collect your basket, cancel at least 2 hours before the slot to get a refund. After that time, the basket is considered lost and no refund will be made."
      },
      {
        "category": "pickup",
        "question": "How do I know when to collect my basket?",
        "answer": "The collection time slot is indicated on the basket listing at the time of reservation. You will also receive a reminder notification 30 minutes before the start of the slot."
      },
      {
        "category": "pickup",
        "question": "Do I need to bring anything for collection?",
        "answer": "You only need your phone with the order QR code displayed in the app. We recommend bringing a reusable bag to carry your basket."
      },
      {
        "category": "account",
        "question": "How do I create a BienBon account?",
